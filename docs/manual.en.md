## Initial Setup

1. Open the [app](https://jl1nie.github.io/rs-ft8n/)
2. The settings panel (gear icon) opens automatically (first time only)
3. Enter the following:
   - **My Callsign** -- your callsign (e.g., `W1AW`)
   - **My Grid** -- your grid locator (e.g., `FN31`)
   - **Audio Input** -- select your USB audio interface (receive side)
   - **Audio Output** -- select TX audio output device (transmit side)
4. **Tap the logo (rs-ft8n)** to start live decoding (logo turns blue)

> Audio device selections are saved in localStorage and automatically restored on next visit. After initial setup, just tap the logo to start.

> For CAT control, select your CAT Protocol in settings and tap **Connect CAT**. Requires Chrome or Edge (Web Serial API).

## Header

```
rs-ft8n [Scout][Snipe]   12s  *
```

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **rs-ft8n logo** | Tap to toggle Audio Start/Stop. Dimmed = stopped, blue = live |
| **Mode tabs** | Scout / Snipe toggle |
| **Seconds remaining** | Integer seconds until next period boundary |
| **Gear icon** | Open settings panel |

---

## Two Modes

### Scout Mode -- Casual CQ Operation

A chat-style UI for relaxed QSOs. Ideal for portable operation and smartphone use.

**Basic operations:**

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **CQ button** | Queue CQ for the next period |
| **Tap waterfall** | Set TX frequency (DF). Shown as a red dashed vertical line |
| **Tap an RX message** | Call the sender (call2) of that message (TX queued for next period) |
| **Auto checkbox** | ON: automatic responses. OFF: manually select TX messages |
| **Halt** | Immediately stop transmission |

**Scout status bar (between waterfall and list):**

```
oooo CALLING  3Y0Z   |   12 decoded (213ms)
```

- Progress dots (4 stages: grey=pending, blue=current, green=done)
- QSO state + DX callsign
- Decode count + decode time
- IDLE: decode info only

**Message display:**

```
--- 12:30 --------------------------
 1234  +0.3  -12  CQ 3Y0Z JD34
  800  +0.1   -8  JA1ABC 3Y0Z PM95
--- 12:45 --------------------------
 1500  +0.2   -5  CQ VK2RG QF56
```

- **DF / DT / SNR / Message** in unified column format
- Period boundaries shown as UTC timestamp inline separator (skipped when 0 decodes)
- Blue border = RX, grey border = TX
- **Yellow bold** = your callsign, **green bold** = QSO partner

**QSO flow (Auto mode):**

1. Tap the waterfall to set DF
2. Tap CQ to queue for next period, or tap an RX message to call that station
3. Response received -- automatic report exchange
4. RR73 / 73 -- QSO complete (auto-saved to log)

**Scout AP decoding:**

During an active QSO, A Priori (AP) decoding is automatically enabled using the QSO partner's callsign (no manual input needed). If decode time exceeds the FT8 budget, AP and subtract are automatically paused (see [Adaptive Budget](#adaptive-budget-scout-mode)).

---

### Snipe Mode -- DX Hunting

A dedicated mode for hunting target stations. The waterfall is larger.

#### Watch Phase (Full-Band Receive)

Find the target and choose a calling frequency.

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Tap waterfall** | Set DF (red dashed line). In Call phase this becomes the 500 Hz window center |
| **Tap an RX message** | Set call1 as target (AP auto-enabled). A secondary "Call call2" button also appears in TX actions |

**Watch display:**

- **Top**: Target station's latest message (call / frequency / SNR)
- **Callers**: List of other stations calling the target
- **Message list**: DF / DT / SNR / Message in unified format (with period separators)
- **QSO progress dots**: filled-circle empty-circle empty-circle empty-circle -> all filled

#### Call Phase (Keep Calling)

Once you've set the DF in Watch, switch to **Call**.

- 500 Hz BPF window shown as a cyan band on the waterfall
- Only messages involving you and the target are displayed (noise reduction)
- Automatically starts calling the target (TX queued for next period)
- QSO failure (retry limit reached) -- auto-reverts to Watch
- You can manually switch back to Watch to change DF

**Switching Watch / Call:**

Use the `[Watch] [Call]` tabs at the top of the Snipe view. The message list is preserved when switching.

---

## Waterfall

Real-time spectrogram covering 200-2800 Hz. Scout: responsive height (min(25vh, 220px)), Snipe: 280px.

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Top labels** | Frequency axis (200, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 Hz) |
| **Red dashed line (vertical)** | DF (TX frequency) -- shown in all modes on tap |
| **Cyan band** | Snipe Call phase 500 Hz BPF window |
| **Red dashed line (horizontal)** | Period boundary (15-second intervals) |
| **Yellow text** | Decoded messages |
| **Tap / click** | Set DF + status bar shows frequency |
| **WAV drag & drop** | Offline analysis (auto-stops live audio) |

---

## TX Actions (Bottom Bar)

All TX is **synchronized to the next period boundary** (never immediate).

| QSO State | Auto ON | Auto OFF |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **IDLE** | `[CQ]` button | `[CQ]` button |
| **Active QSO** | Single next-TX message | All TX options as buttons |

- **Snipe**: A secondary `[Call xxx]` button appears when call2 differs from the target
- **Halt**: Immediately stops transmission (cancels queued TX)
- Status bar shows `TX queued: ...` when TX is pending

---

## QSO State Machine

QSO management uses a 4-state progression:

```
IDLE -> CALLING -> REPORT -> FINAL -> IDLE (complete)
```

| State | Meaning | TX content |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **IDLE** | Standby | -- |
| **CALLING** | Calling | `DX MYCALL GRID` or `CQ MYCALL GRID` |
| **REPORT** | Report exchange | `DX MYCALL R+00` |
| **FINAL** | Awaiting confirmation | `DX MYCALL RR73` or `73` |

- **Auto ON**: Fully automatic state transitions. Retries on no response (up to 15 times).
- **Auto OFF**: TX message selector buttons appear for manual selection.
- When the retry limit is reached, the QSO is logged as incomplete.

---

## Adaptive Budget (Scout Mode)

In Scout mode, when decode time exceeds the FT8 budget (2.4 seconds), heavy features are automatically paused in order:

| Priority | Feature | Load |
|----------|---------|------|
| 1 (OFF first) | Multi-pass subtract | 3-pass SIC (heaviest) |
| 2 (OFF next) | A Priori (AP) | Sniper + EQ single pass |

The status bar shows `[-sub]` or `[-sub,AP]` when features are paused.

Recovery at 60% budget headroom, in reverse order:
1. AP re-enabled first
2. Subtract re-enabled when budget allows

Snipe mode always runs both features (narrow band = fast enough).

---

## Callsign Hash Resolution

Some FT8 message types (Type 4 non-standard calls, DXpedition messages, etc.) transmit callsigns as 10/12/22-bit hashes. Normally displayed as `<...>`, rs-ft8n automatically builds a **hash table from decoded callsigns** and resolves hashes to actual calls like `<JA1ABC>` in subsequent messages.

The table accumulates during the WASM session (max 1000 entries, LRU eviction) and clears on page reload.

---

## Settings Panel

Open/close with the gear icon.

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **My Callsign** | Your callsign |
| **My Grid** | Grid locator (4 characters) |
| **Audio Input** | Receive audio device (selection auto-saved) |
| **Audio Output** | TX audio output device (selection auto-saved) |
| **CAT Protocol** | Yaesu (FTDX10) / Icom (CI-V) |
| **Connect CAT** | Connect to rig via Web Serial (PTT control) |
| **Start / Stop Audio** | Start or stop live decoding (also via logo tap) |
| **Reset QSO** | Abort QSO (saved as incomplete to log) |
| **Open WAV File** | Select a WAV file for offline analysis |
| **Multi-pass subtract** | Successive interference cancellation (3-pass SIC). Default ON. Auto-paused over budget |
| **A Priori (AP)** | AP decoding. Default ON. Auto-paused over budget |

> AP target is set automatically -- from the QSO partner in Scout mode, or from the tapped target in Snipe mode. No manual input needed.

---

## Log Management

### Auto-Save

- **QSO complete**: Automatically saved to localStorage (state = IDLE)
- **QSO aborted**: Saved as incomplete on Reset or retry timeout (state = CALLING/REPORT/FINAL)
- **All RX messages**: All decoded messages accumulated in RX log (max 10,000 entries)

### ZIP Export

Tap **Export ZIP (ADIF + RX)** in the settings panel to download a ZIP containing 3 files:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `qso_complete_YYYYMMDD.adi` | Completed QSOs only (for LoTW / Club Log upload) |
| `qso_all_YYYYMMDD.adi` | All QSOs (incomplete entries include `<COMMENT>incomplete:STATE</COMMENT>`) |
| `rx_YYYYMMDD.csv` | All received decode log (UTC, Freq, SNR, Message) |

### Clearing Logs

**Clear All Logs** button deletes both QSO and RX logs (confirmation dialog shown).

---

## Offline Analysis with WAV Files

Drag & drop a WAV file onto the waterfall, or use **Open WAV File** in the settings panel.

- **Requirements**: 12 kHz / 16-bit / mono WAV
- Auto-stops live audio if active
- Waterfall + decode results displayed immediately

---

## CAT Control

Uses the Web Serial API to control rig PTT from the browser.

**Supported protocols:**

| Protocol | Example rigs | Baud rate |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Yaesu** | FTDX10, FT-991A, etc. | 38400 |
| **Icom CI-V** | IC-7300, IC-705, etc. | 19200 |

**Connection steps:**

1. Connect your rig to the PC via USB cable
2. Select CAT Protocol in the settings panel
3. **Connect CAT** -- browser serial port selection dialog opens
4. Select the port -- connected
5. PTT is automatically controlled during TX

> Web Serial API is only available in Chrome / Edge. Safari / Firefox are not supported.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Logo stays dimmed | Tap logo to start audio. Check Audio Input is selected in settings |
| 0 decodes | Check antenna, audio level, and frequency (e.g., 14.074 MHz) |
| WAV drop error | Verify 12 kHz / 16-bit / mono format. 48 kHz WAV is not supported |
| CAT won't connect | Use Chrome / Edge. Restart browser and retry |
| Waterfall is black | Verify the correct Audio Input device. Tap logo to restart |
| QSO not progressing | Check that Auto is ON. Tap an RX message to select the target station |
| `[-sub]` `[-sub,AP]` shown | Decode is too heavy; features auto-paused. Will recover when budget allows |
| `<...>` not resolved | That station hasn't been decoded in this session. Hash table clears on page reload |
