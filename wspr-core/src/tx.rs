//! WSPR transmitter path: channel symbols → audio samples.
//!
//! Pragmatic first-pass synthesiser for end-to-end decoder tests. Each
//! symbol emits one continuous-phase sinusoid at
//! `base_freq + symbol * tone_spacing` for `NSPS / sample_rate` seconds.
//! No GFSK shaping yet — plain CPFSK is close enough in the narrowband
//! limit that WSPR's FFT-based demod sees the same spectral peaks.
//!
//! A real over-the-air WSPR transmitter applies a raised-cosine pulse to
//! smooth symbol transitions; adding that here is straightforward follow
//! up (pre-compute a pulse table, convolve symbol-boundary regions) but
//! not required for the decode-roundtrip tests this module enables.
